WARNING:

Usage of the "mozilla" variable in the BROWSERS array is depreciated starting with profile-sync-daemon v4.00.
It has been replaced with the "firefox" variable.

In order to safely upgrade, you must run an unsync to rotate your firefox profile back to disk using verion 3.x

As usual, watch for any changes in the newly provided /etc/psd.conf as well and be sure to incorporate them.
